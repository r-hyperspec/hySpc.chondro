# R package **hySpc.chondro**

Package **hySpc.chondro** is a part of [**hyperSpec**](https://r-hyperspec.github.io/) family packages.
It contains `chondro`[^1] dataset, which is so-called _Raman map_: [Raman scattering spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy) of a cartilage section measured on each point of a grid. 

[^1]: Word `chondro` is based on word ["chondrocytes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte), cells found in cartilage.
